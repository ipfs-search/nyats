Not Yet Another Thumbnail Service, thumbnailer for [ipfs-search.com](https://ipfs-search.com)

IPFS caching thumbnailer. Generates thumbnails for IPFS CID's, adds them to IPFS node (if not pre-existing) and redirects to IPFS URL, while regularly publishing to IPNS. Soon, we will be able to use IPNS as a cache, so clients will not even need to hit the server.

## Packages

- [nyats-server](packages/server#readme): API server rendering thumbnails for IPFS content.
- [nyats-client](packages/client#readme): Client for API server, generating appropriate URL's for generating and requesting thumbnails.
- [nyats-vuetify-img](packages/vuetify-img#readme): Vuetify3 thumbnailing component, based on v-img, rendering thumbnails for IPFS CID's using IPNS for caching and nyats API as fallback.

## Getting started

To use any of the aforementioned packages, please refer to their respective README's.

As for developing, we're using [lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) to organize nyats-related packages together and to manage their dependencies. Common development dependencies reside in the root repository.

To start developing, you can install all the project's dependencies as follows:

```sh
npm i && npm run bootstrap
```

## Commands

To facilitate development, the following commands will be run through the root package on all subpackages (which have that command available):

- `npm run bootstrap`: Install packages and their dependencies, such that they can use one another.
- `npm run build`: Build packages.
- `npm run test`: Test packages.
- `npm run lint`: Lint packages.
- `npm run clean`: ... ok, you get the gist, no?
- `npm run publish`: Also, yeah... publish All the Packages!
